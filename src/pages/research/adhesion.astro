            Functionnaly graded adhesives from nanostructured epoxy adhesives
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ph.D. funded by a national project (codenamed WASPE, led by a
            consortium of AIRBUS, EADS and SAFRAN). The objectives were the
            development, preparation and characterization of functionally graded
            epoxy adhesives (FGA). Preparation of the FGA were made such as the
            methodology and protocol were industrial-ready. Physico-chemical and
            mechanical characterization of epoxy adhesives were performed using
            various instrumentation (DSC, FTIR, DMTA, SEM, free surface energy â€“
            Digital Image Correlation, tensile and fracture tests). The FGA
            developed showed higher mechanical properties in terms of adhesion
            and hygrothermal ageing resistance. Main results have been published
            and presented in both international and national conferences, as
            well as reported to industrial partners.

            Electric field assisted protein adsorption on metallic substrates
        </h3>
        <p>
            We investigated an alternate technique to coat the surface with a
            protein having no surface affinity, without the use of any exotic
            chemical agents. An external electric field was utilized to prepare
            the protein coating on a metal substrate. Stainless steel (St)
            substrate and lysozyme (LSZ) were used as the surface to be coated
            and the model non-adsorptive protein, respectively. Dynamics of the
            adsorption of LSZ on the St surface in the presence and absence of
            an external electric potential (EEP) were monitored by in-situ
            ellipsometry. Applying negative surface potential (L0.4 V vs
            Ag/AgCl) forced the adsorption of LSZ onto the St surface where LSZ
            did not adsorb without applying any EEP. The repetition of the
            EEP-application and -cut-off indicated the controllability of the
            LSZ coating amount depending on the total duration of the
            EEP-application. The coated LSZ largely remained bound to the
            surface even by the cut-off of the external electric field, the
            ratio of which to the detached amount was roughly constant
            (approximately 7:3). Furthermore, the LSZ coated surface on the St
            substrate was found to be reversibly switched between being
            affinitive and non-affinitive to a typical model protein adsorbate
            (bovine serum albumin) by the EEP-application and cut-off.
